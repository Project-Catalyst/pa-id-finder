Maybe more possible paths to adoption could have been explored in the solution. The proposed metrics seem to be relatively underwhelming. \nDiversity of  artists by end of alpha period does not seem to be an important factor in my view, as it is not a true measure of success - when 4 artists are involved. The limited beta is anyway out of the scope of the F5 proposal. The weekly active platform-integrated users - demonstrating broad adoption - is a metric, but what will represent succcess is not clear from the proposal. Also the number of monthly private-stream events will be a number that can be clocked, but what is success? A trend? A finite number?

For those people however, such astronomically high anual rates are a very hard to cope with expense which have the potential do drive them even more into poverty, so qualifying this into doing something good as it is done in the proposal is difficult. As the rates in this business model are set, it is rather a model to earn ADA holders a higher APY than they would get by regular staking and additionally provide profit to the operators of the crowdlending platform at the cost of high rates for the people renting the homes. In order for the proposal to make a worthy addition to the DeFi-ecosystem of Cardano, the thoughts behind it's financial setup need to be made more transparent in order for it to be justified.

The impact of the proposed platform and the DApp will be measured by its ultimate success in resolving a longstanding problem - hence the devil will be in the details of the relationship between farmers and citizen investors, in their communication, expectations, deliverables, progress measurement, addressing issues of production volumes/quality, insurance, force majeure, market disruptions. \nThere are many things that can go wrong in agriculture and a platform in which citizens can invest in farmers will have to take many things into account if it is to be effective. Building a platform by itself will not guarrantee success. The campaign brief states that \"Quality Dapps and integrations will increase utility & adoption of Cardano\". The idea does have quality, but what I would like to see more is the devilish detail that would indicate that the proposal will deliver solutions to difficult problems - that would put the \"Quality\" in the proposal and in the proposed DApp and platform and smart contracts. \n\n",

The proposal is of clear value to Cardano and I believe the proponents have tried to leverage their expertise to maximize the returns (focus on more technical materials), which I find positive.  ",

There is still centralization in some aspects, but a concept that allows a more decentralized and fair model of price discovery (odds)\n\nLetting a person set their own odds is a poor design choice and not user friendly, as it does not allow liquidity. it's like placing a sales order on an order book exchange and waiting for someone to fill that order.\n\nSellers want to charge a value above the ideal and buyers want to pay for a value below the ideal, how to make the odds of the bets approach and make the proposal viable?\n\nBookmakers resemble market makers and in the context of supply and demand design they reduce spreads and make the service viable.\n\nMy recommendation is that the proposer better describe how this proposal will scale and how it will generate liquidity so that the bets are combined.\n\nThe proposal has a serious dependence on a centralized oracle and this makes room for corruption and liveliness.\n\nThere is not enough information to judge the feasibility of the budget, as the proposal does not describe enough details to understand the work required to develop the project.",

Does the production facility need to be built? if so what's the plan? There is significant risk of failure if the infrastructure for processing and moving materials is not yet built.

I thought Catalyst is currently the largest decentralized innovation fund in the world-- so relatively speaking, it may not necessarily be the most urgent problem, but please clarify why you think this is a problem.\n \nSolution Statement:\n\n - Will the platforms you suggest contain the sort of audience that will be valuable with respect to submitting proposals to Catalyst?  Will the participation be meaningful?  If so, why?\n\n - How will this increase 'efficiency', as you suggest?\n\n - It seems like cryptotexty is very Ukraine-centric, despite English translations being available.  I am not saying this is a bad thing, and I think it only helps to increase promotional efforts in all regions; but given Cardano's initial emphasis on Africa, and the limited funds available, why do you think it is valuable to concentrate promotional efforts in Ukraine (if my premise is correct)?\n",

The idea is good when it comes to innovation and to focus on the use of technology that Cardano develops, and it is certainly a new way of looking at this relationship between people and pets. However, I am not sure if the public will find the proposal interesting and will be open to doing this, I think it is a matter of trying and observing the results. In my view, the proposal has a chance of working very well or being just an attempt that did not get much return, because it is very different from the other activities in this medium. A very important point to be considered is how these animals will be treated. An animal is not a toy, it should not be seen as a source of profit. If, for example, 4 users wish to play with the same rabbit on the same afternoon, that animal will be exhausted. I think it is essential to plan and supervise the treatment and welfare of rabbits very well, so that the project does not become just a source of profit that exploits animals. ",

When Bitcoin came into being it wasn't considered a store of value, but its properties and the immutability of these properties over time made Bitcoin a store of value.\n\nADA can also be a store of value, but the biggest challenge for this is monetary policy, so this is a topic that is totally relevant for a blockchain that intends to become widely accepted and fulfill the ideal for which cryptocurrencies were designed, give power back to the individual.\n\n\nOne of the aspects that guarantees the security of a PoS blockchain is the cost to cause a 51% attack, so in theory the greater the ADA's market value, the greater the relative security. Because of this, it is important that monetary policy is designed to preserve the value of the currency and create incentive mechanisms (annualized income subsidized by inflation + treasury). In the future the idea is that the fees replace the subsidy and the incentives to use feedback to the security of the protocol.\n\nStudies on monetary policy are essential for the community to understand the impact of changes in the blockchain's base parameters. Over the past few months we have noticed a considerable increase in the transaction fees of the blockchain as the tx fee doesn't take into account the price appreciation of the ADA asset. This type of tx fee will be defined by governance and for the community to make this type of decision it is essential that there are people studying the impact of these changes. Today the IOG is in charge of this work, but creating this challenge will allow the community to begin to assume an important role for the decentralization of Cardano.",

It may be worth waiting until IOHK's research and proposals in this regard are clearer. What arguably should never be questioned is the need for ADA as the key to EUTXO in the base layer, and the value of its being scarce and highly functional.

The proposal reads: \"measure number of custom catalyst experiences, quality of engagement during proposal iteration and during voting, etc\" 1. In this item etc. is not adequate. It is necessary to list specifically, the items the proponent believes need to be verified. The proponent could be right or wrong. There could be more items and people could identify more and better items, but it is necessary that the proponent does and shows their effort. It is necessary that the proponent reports their best work, for it to be improved by the community. Without their work, there is not much to build on. 2) It is important to define what a \"custom experience\" is in a manner that can be shared and therefore verified by many. There does not need to be a unique perfect definition but there needs to be a minimal definition that we can discuss and agree around. Furthermore, it is necessary that we can identify specific qualities of that definition that we can verify. This is the goal of this criteria. For example, you could say there will be experiences in the seven major world languages (or Cardano languages, English, Vietnamese, etc...), and you could say this would be measured by the number of catalysts web pages translated into those languages. From there you could go into as much detail as you believe is necessary. 3) Lastly, it is necessary to provide an idea of how to measure \"quality of engagement\". This is not easy and there probably is a lot of disagreement. But, if this is going to determine the verifiability of the project it is necessary to provide a definition and characteristics that we can agree on and verify. Furthermore, notice that this is required for different stages of the Catalysts process and therefore, I believe it could be expected that the definition and characteristics to verify \"quality of engagement\" across these different stages will need to be defined for each of those Catalyst stages.

Security and provenance for particular items can be proven within metadata itself, rather than relying on smart contracts, which is different from other blockchains particularly at the scale and distribution capacity of Cardano's network. It is important that transaction fees, which are in the long term the lifeblood and security of the system as well as underpinning of value in the token which keeps users engaged are secured for the network by having a dynamic ecosystem to support NFT uses in scale and over the long term, therefore it is important for this use of Cardano to be supported with Treasury funds. It is important also to demonstrate the willingness of developers to code these functions on Cardano in as broad as possible a range of use cases, in addition to deep functionality in each use case that differentiates Cardano as a solution.",

For example, in the budget that is provided, there are 3 engineers - why is 3 the right number? Could it be completed with 2? Why/why not? Also, the \"founder\" position is not described anywhere and I fail to understand what this position is, why it's valued at $76K and how it fits into the overall project design. \nFurther things I'd point out under implementation likelihood are:\nUnder \"Deliverables for first 4 months\", it states that the partnerships with custodians will be finalized. The proposal could benefit from providing additional information on where/with whom those partnerships currently are, what stage they are at, what challenges may still exist, and what form the final agreement will take. This would help determine the likelihood that implementation would be successful. \nMoreover, since the catalyst funding represents only a portion of the overall budget and experience required for the project there is some uncertainty (or at least it's not overly clear) as to how the rest would be funded.

Through further Catalyst funds? \nThe proposal could be strengthened by providing additional information on what I note here. \n",

Jurisdictions where Uber is subject to regulations where there is a considerable increase in tax burdens often cause Uber to simply stop operating in these jurisdictions.

However, it is important to keep in mind that many social platforms exist even in the centralized world and most of them are worth nothing. The very problem statement might be a problem for me as it specifies that \"most low level users in crypto's first and only experience with crypto is on Coinbase and then nothing after that\". Not sure how big of a problem is that and whether the statement is true at all. Is a general statement and the the proposal is designed to solve that \" problem statement\". Most people's experience with cash is to use it as much as they need and that in my view is not a \"problem\". The problem might be providing more different uses that will make crypto useful, not inventing new ways of engaging consumers in order to \"fool them\" (my words) to use it more. The proposed solution \"creation of a platform that anyone can join, buy crypto and actively transact on the blockchain (maybe without even knowing it)\" seems impossible because of the effective legislation that is in place around crypto. Most crypto exchanges will require cystomers to go through a crypto KYC (Know Your Customer) process before buying and cashing out and just swapping an exchange for a \"world building social platform\" will not exclude this platform from KYC requirements. This issue does not seem to be addressed although the proposal does propose a platform for buying crypto. So I am not sure whether the proposal will be able to result in a novel and viable application that will attract users in real life. So, I would include more information about the restrictions in buying crypto and trading it and how this will be addressed. ",

There is a lot of information about the social world/platform - but an idea is different from a funding proposal. A successful funding proposal needs to be on the cusp of realization, one step away from full implementation - practically ready-to-go as soon as funding is made available. In this case, I don't see those required elements. The experience listed states: \"I have been developing apps for the last 5 years and have helped scale multiple saas companies to 50k+ mrr.\" My quibble with this listed experience is that anyone can develop apps, what would prove relevant experience is successful apps or a trend of building better and more successful apps.

Also it would be great if those multiple saas companies that have been helped to scale to 50k+ mrr were listed by name ... as well as the exact contribution of the proposer.

The absence of a robust tokenomics model hinders the project's feasiblity.

The remaining half will need alternative methods of funding, an ICO can be an alternative method. I believe that the budget is not reasonable, as there are fundamental aspects about the plan that are still unclear and this creates doubts about the definition of the budget. The fact that the requested amount fund only half of the development compromises the auditability the proposal.\n\nCompliance and regulation risks were not considered and this is a key aspect to assess the feasibility of the proposal. Integrating DeFi with government-related systems is a major challenge and projects could take years to establish a framework. IOG's own partnership with the government of Ethiopia demonstrated the great difficulty in inserting solutions created in public blockchains to the government. When observing the development of blockchain-related technologies by governments out there, the delay of governments in the development of CBDCs is notable and the bureaucracy involved in the process makes integration difficult. In addition, there is a great preference for governments to use private blockchains. These risks need to be taken into account as they bring risks to the proposal's success and there is still no plan that demonstrates how this type of risks will be faced.\n\nThe use of blockchain for bill payment brings additional risks to users' privacy, and there is still no private computing solution available at Cardano. The lack of privacy in these transactions can bring risks to users of this model, because when making payments the user exposes his balance.\n\nReceiving payments in ADA implies that the recipient will have to deal with volatility. There is still no decentralized option for converting ADA, as until July (until Alonzo HFC) there will be no DEXs and stable coins on Cardano, which creates friction in this model. This could be circumvented by using someone to take custody (centralized exchanges) but it would go against the purpose of DeFi and in the opposite direction to the basic concepts of DeFi, which deal with removing intermediaries, removing trust and bringing more costs.\n\n",

Simply requesting $3,000 for the charity without further explanation of how those funds will be used or how the charity will be organized and run does not provide sufficient information to agree that the charity is a feasible component of the project. I agree the other aspects of the project are feasible; but because the charity is a significant part of the project budget, I cannot agree the project overall is feasible.",

    "assessmentNote": "I personally like the idea of creating a real-time traceable supply chain DApp for all insect related products. It is great! The idea is massive and its implications.\n\nHowever, while the idea is great, the proposal has some weaknesses. \n\nIn effect the idea is great, but a Catalyst proposal is a step up from an idea. The proposal is being assessed here. \n\nThe proposer does identify a very big global market (and an initial one in Southeast Asia) that the DApp would focus on. I am wondering whether centralized Apps or traceability services exist for this market that this proposed DApp can be compared to? If yes, it would have been good to be able to compare their specific weaknesses and how the proposed DApp would address those issues and provide users with additional value. \n\nIf these centralized Apps or services do not exist yet, is there a reason why they are not available? \n\nBuilding a DApp (or application) is just one part of providing any true product traceability - it seems to require integration with a comprehensive traceability system with procedures and guidelines. \n\nIt is unclear to me whether this is a DApp that is part of a wider proposed system. Or is it a DApp that will also be able to integrate with existing traceability platforms. If a new traceability system is being proposed - I fail to see the details of that system in the proposal. \n\nA real-time traceable supply chain DApp would be one component- however the proposal would have benefited from fleshing out other aspects - such as strengths, limitations, and risks of the new traceability system or others that it will integrate with. The ultimate success of a decentralized insect related traceability system may not depend only on the DApp itself. \n\nI would have liked to see other components of the bigger jigsaw addressed as well - in order to assess its full impact and whether it will be able to add value to the Cardano ecosystem. \n\nThe issue is that if the proposed traceability system is not up to par as a whole, the DApp might not add value to the Cardano ecosystem. How will compliance be ensured? How will consumers be able to rely on the soundness of information that is accessible via the DApp? How will identity be managed? WIll Atala Prism ( decentralized identity solution built on the Cardano blockchain) be used? Etc...\n\nThe proposer specifies that a full pitch deck and plan outline are available on request. The proposal would have benefited from their inclusion - as without them it is difficult to assess the impact of a DApp alone on such a sector. The DApp is a tool - but the full solution of the proposed traceability system (or integration with other systems) - is key to measure the potential benefits to the Cardano ecosystem. \n\nThe platform may be able to connect consumers, brands, and farmers in real time, removing the need for trust in institutions by transparent verification of the entire process - but the issue of trust among the participants remains. Maybe institutions do not need to be trusted, but how is the new DApp verifying that the information on the blockchain is correct? How are key elements verified (quality, volumes, sourcing, deliveries, etc..)? \n",

The design and characteristics of the DApp are key to its success and to being able to assess how effectively it addresses the challenge, as well as its linkage to a good traceability system. \n\nSuccess in this challenge is not just building a novel application of top of Cardano, but the application also has to be viable in order to attract users. \n\nThe proposal lacks sufficient Metrics/KPIs that would help define the success of the proposal. To me the proposal would need to drill down on metrics and KPIs more, as building a DApp is not sufficient for the proposed system - it is part of a larger farm-to-fork traceability endeavor that is being proposed.

I found the following statement concerning: \"A full list of proposed Infographic will be developed at the time of funding\". The proponent has demonstrated experience with the process but nevertheless could not, or, chose not to, enunciate or demonstrate their understanding of the requirement for visual resources to explain it.  Furthermore, there are incomplete and undeveloped statements like \"Look at build out a more detailed process of funding graphics and engaging a wider range of graphic designers - for future funding rounds.\", which seems to be leftover from a previous assessment.

Considering that this proposal has a high degree of technical complexity, it is important that we can understand the team's expertise required to develop smart contracts, as the development of smart contracts for loans requires a high degree of reliability. It will be necessary to hire more people to develop the proposal and this raises doubts about the feasibility of the project and the budget.\n\nRequiring KYC in a DeFi dapp is counter intuitive, as one of the great pros of DeFi for unbanked people is that these people do not have documents to access credit lines, so getting KYC excludes these people from the protocol, in addition KYC brings problems for privacy and compromise censorshipo resistance, ultimately for a DeFi dapp to be able to deploy a credit score system and enable undercolateralized loan in a decentralized way it is necessary to implement DIDs and there is no mention of this in the proposal.\n\nThe idea of \u200b\u200busing KYC without DIDs makes the application centralized because it has a dependence on trust, this removes several benefits for using blockchain, which goes against the goal of DeFi. Creating a centralized protocol and sekk decentralize over time has proved to be a failure in the DeFi environment, as DeFi is naturally less user friendly and incentives end up causing the vast majority of DeFi projects to abandon the search for decentralization or to prolong decentralization. . My recommendation is that the proposer look for an option to implement DIDs in the dapp.\n\n\nThere are no details to explain the technical difficulties for the development of dapp, considering that this proposal requires the development of smart contracts for mission critical applications (finance) it is important to clarify whether dapp will be developed in Haskell, margin call mechanisms, what will be the dapp financial model , the need for a token or not, etc ...\n\nThere is a budget breakdown, but considering that the development of smart contracts is defined in the budget, it is important to specify the technical capacity of the proposer to develop smart contracts.",

Each of us can simply look at our storage needs and we can all admit that what we have now is never enough. Cardano itself may begin seeing data-storage issues after Alonzo is released. As it currently stands, and with CNFTs being minted without smart contracts, a blockfrost.io proposal claims huge amounts of data already going through their APIs that they have had to present proposals themselves to deal with traffic. That their proposal has nothing to do with storage, but the traffic they observe reveals a lot about the data storage needs of our community. I initially wondered if this should simply be a DApp proposal that could be submitted under normal challenges but given current crypto-projects dealing with this issue are themselves multi-billion dollar projects, I recognise that even the $350000 price tag may not even be enough.

In addition, there are many different vaccines and countries have different vaccine acceptance standards.\n\nThe creation of a covid-19 passport by governments can be a step towards a social credit score system, which is something that really threatens individual freedoms and goes against the ideal of public blockchains.

From the development point of view there are indications that the team is able to execute the proposal. It is unclear who will perform the translation or the team's ability to translate. My point is:\n\nWill this be a professional translation? I don't see the need for a professional translation, as the focus is on transmitting the content, but about 80% of the proposal's budget will be used for the translation of proposals, and it should be noted that, using an extension in the browser, a user can achieve practically the same quality of translation and will probably achieve the same understanding.\n\nIf we are thinking about translation quality it may be that an automatic translator is not perfect, but if the aim is a professional translation it would be important to describe the team's experience in translation.\n\nTranslation costs are inconclusive, as the definition of translation cost was established in cost per hour and not cost per word, without a definition of proposals to be translated or payment to be made per translated word, the auditability became hard to measure.\n\nThere is a justified concern with the translation of Catalyst material to expand the reach in communities that speak other languages \u200b\u200b/ do not understand English, however it is necessary to reflect on the feasibility of translating proposals, as this would generate a great additional cost and would end up maintaining the community in silos, since for people who speak different languages \u200b\u200bthey need to interact at some point and this proposal doesn't solve this problem.\n\nSome risks that I think are important to mention:\n\nThere is mention that only part of the proposals will be translated, I think it is important to define this more clearly, as this makes the translation process arbitrary, it can be any number. In addition, a conflict of interest may arise, as the translation and curation of these proposals would be limited to the intention of the ALDEA team.",

However, if it's of the intent to tackle one region and making sure that it's yielding a better results before attending to other regions then the proposal is on coarse. \nI'm saying this because, West Africa has the most weird and hypocritical countries ever when we talk about Technological Advancement. And this is so because, leaders operating in various countries like Ghana, Nigeria, Cameroon, Togo and many others are just corrupt and continues to be corrupt with no remorse.  \nInstead, the citizens are much enthusiastic about Technological Advancement and Development but their barrier is that they're not getting the opportunity to meet corporate organizations who's got this passion and mission of training people to becoming developers! And the painful aspect is, these corrupt leaders turn deaf ears to their demands as citizens too. If this project attacks from the root \"citizens\" and provide strong education to the leaders in order for to understand, it will be wise as once they're enlightened, it will be easy for adoption, acceptance and adjustments.\nAlso, cost of infrastructure is one blow to the eye. Office spaces which are just for rent (unfurnished) could cost more than 10,000$ for just two years and and furnishing alone could cost sometimes more than 5,000$. Imagine if 10 countries/hubs are to be created simultaneously, each hub might consume not less than 30,000$. So 125,695$ wouldn't be enough right?\nThis proposal addressed the issue of legitimacy. I'll commend that approach but my only advice is, they should be extra vigilant in carrying out that exercise else they might end up spending more than supposed to. This is so because, once setting up of new agency is involved, whether profitable or non-profitable, several institutions will approach trying to you know get a cut of the cake. In Ghana for instance, the only institution to receive a legit certification and approval is the Office of the Attorney General. Further research must be done vigilantly to ensure smooth operation.\n\nThis proposal, I recommend that it be voted for! It will be fantastic to see their operations.",

An idea would be a profile on instagram, focused on posting the news of the channel, extra mini complementary content, stories talking curiosities about the theme and etc. This profile could be the main channel of communication with the potential public, and through paid advertising and partnership with other profiles already more consolidated, of the same branch, it would certainly be possible to reach more people and attract them to the channel. He would need people dedicated exclusively to feeding and maintaining the relevant profile, graphic design, for example, would be indispensable in the correct elaboration of the posts. The second point is how exactly the investment money would be allocated, what equipment the author intends to buy, how he will use it, what kind of professionals he intends to hire to form his team and with what functions they will work. These questions are not very detailed, nor how would these video lessons on the subject take place: if they would be short, medium or long videos, with exactly what kind of didactics they would be taught ...

To greatly increase the potential for success of the proposal I would suggest two things. 1) That the proposal is focused on piloting a relatively small, well-known, and well-supported (regarding infrastructure) region. And, 2) That instead of creating Hubs 'de Novo' (new, from scratch, etc.), the proposal focuses on refurbishing existing hubs as Carnano Hubs. For the first point, I suggest the authors take an area they know well and propose to build the ten hubs there as a demonstration (this could be in a province in India, a city in Africa, or a small natural region in Latin America). It should be a region where there is electricity, internet, a minimal tradition of computers' use, stable government, etc. For the second point, I suggest that in such a region they can find existing institutions that can be transformed into Cardano Hubs, for example, a public school or a private school, a public library. In Latin America, we have places like cultural centers that function as meeting and teaching places, like Volkhochschule in Germany, places for continuous education. An even better example would be internet services (cafe internet) these are private places where the owner lends computers to the public for hours, to do government tasks (registers), homework, research or play video games. A place like this already has a technical and social infrastructure that can be harnessed for a Cardano Hub at a gain for the owner, the community, and Cardano.

It would be very important to adequately consider the involvement of social scientists to carefully and objectivelly document the last point. Finally, as mentioned in the previous point, documenting well the project would be a major requirement and that requires the involvement of someone versatile in communications (blogging, vlogging, video documentary, podcasting).

It may be important to bring ortists onto the team, in the creation of the mechanism, which then may create from the artist up, rather than from the mechanism down, to the artist. Artists often create from unique disjunctures in cultures. These \"breaks\" in language create unique semantic structures. This could further drive the mechanism you are creating towards something new, and needed. ",

This means that not only is DOS attack an unrealistic risk vector, it means the smart contract can actually scale to meet the demand of a large user base. Nowhere in the proposal does the author mention this as it ruins there narrative that UTXO needs an account view, it does not, and the devs at IOHK have made it clear how Plutus contracts can be constructed to mitigate the \"race to the UTXO\" problem.\n\nThe proposal also conflates the Ethereum transaction mempool process with Cardano's which is another fatal flaw since these are vastly different ",

How the students would see receiving an email from something that they don't know. I really thing that they wouldn't open it \u2013 since nowadays the selling of private information like email to industries and companies are present, they might receive thousands of emails every day.\nI really think that a project more community involved would be of a greater impact. We already have lots of members across the world with great credentials and who are willing to help. Maybe create a platform which put these people together and which aims create a presentation and validate a method that could be presented inside the universities and colleges around the world, but presential \u2013 would be much more appealing.\n",

The vast majority of users and transactions related to DeFi on Ethereum occur through only one wallet, Metamask, so having multiple wallets is not a requirement to have a functioning DeFi ecosystem.\n\nThe creation of an unofficial wallet by an unknown team, the absence of a detailed and structured plan and the absence of goals or metrics do not indicate a positive outcome for this proposal in relation to this challenge and for Cardano's ecosystem.\n\nI recommend that the team describe details about the plan, indicate who will be involved in the proposal and what additional benefit Gero Wallet would bring over the official wallets (Yoroi and Daedalus).",

He previously served in the military ... bachelor's degree in computer science and mathematics from Columbia  ... .bachelor's in economics and political science from Brown University.... Studying part-time at Georgia Tech to earn his master's degree in computer science...\nSo the relevant skill and experience seem to be in place. \nAlthough the proposal does not break down the budget into components (a potential weakness as the Community Advisor Assessment Guide asks that the budget be outlined clearly and broken down into identifiable items). Fortunately, the proposer did respond to a comment about the budget and stated that he would be required to pay 25-30% of this amount in taxes plus some funds would be used for overhead for a web presence and ensuring that legal precautions are taken. So, we have some budget breakdown provided - although not a full one. Also the unspecified funds for overhead and legal precautions - should be quantified. \nAs regards future maintenance costs, the proposer does consider that (also in the comments) - and he maintains that if the API changes and ongoing development will be needed to support multi-assets - \"a startup could be formed that would make this service hosted\"... \nI didn't see a proposed timetable to complete the work.

Recalling that the team has a proposal in this same challenge that deals with the creation of a webpage with details about the teams, so the members themselves are well aware of the importance of having details of the proposers and even so they forgot to include this information. It is important to note that the project is already under development and the team is already adding information about the updates, which shows commitment.\n\nThere is a confusing aspect to the plan, the creation of a calendar, information and documentation will require constant updating and the budget describes funding for only 3 weeks of work. How will be the update of this information? This is not clear. There is a mention that in the long run more information will be added, but would that involve more funding?\n\nThe point is that to understand the feasibility of the budget, there must be clear deliverables, if the budget is only intended to create a calendar and aggregate information (something that is subjective and unclear in the proposal description) I believe that budget is unreasonable and above what is necessary.\n\nIn any case, it is not possible to be sure because the deliverables are not clear and there is no clarity as to whether the updates are included in the budget.",

As mentioned, the roadmap is extensive but there is no sandbox period to test the security of the system. I would like to see more documentation on these concepts. Also one more thing is not fully clear to me, this in game currency, how will it be denominated? I think this must be defind clearly before even making an API. And if it is in most likely event pegged to a Fiat currency then this needs more regulative understanding and clearence. In general, my two concerns are for non-blockchain server security and in-game currency implementation (concepts, issuance, governance).

    "assessmentNote": "Impact - 4\nThis proposal strives to a address a critical need that must be addressed - how can the Cardano community actively promote and invest in societal diversity and equity in Africa, as well as other regions with little representation in current SPOs.  Addressing this need will help the Cardano community address the two objectives listed in the campaign brief: \n(1) Cardano is considered the best public block-chain operating in Africa; and \n(2) Cardano projects in Africa are not isolated but networked and growing.  \nCardano cannot be considered the best public block-chain operating in Africa if it lacks a critical mass of SPOs based in Africa; and supporting a critical mass of SPOs in Africa will provide an important network to support and grow Cardano projects throughout Africa.\n\nThe proposal's solutions offer a sound, general roadmap for addressing the problem identified. It would bring together a steering group of relevant, knowledgeable stakeholders; it would strive to understand and quantify current diversity; it would develop a new SPO evaluation, ranking system, and prototype tool to enable stake delegation that benefits representational and decentralization goals; and it would collaborate with staking information services. These are all excellent elements to include.\n\nBut my main concern is the proposal's description of what success looks like.  The proposal currently lists three descriptions:\n1) Continuous measurement and reporting on Global and African level societal decentralisation,\n2) Transparent, principled, objective based SPO recommendations, and\n3) Increase African and Societal level decentralisation through adoption by staking information services (has dependencies).\nAs written right now, these descriptions of success are laudable, but also lack measureable criteria that can be used to measure the project's progress and success.  For example, what is the anticipated time necessary to execute the different solutions?  Is there a specific, measurable outcome that is desired as part of the SPO recommendations? A transparent, principled, and objective process is essential to any recommendation, but what is the desired outcome? (e.g. x number of people informed? y number of SPO's evaluated, etc). What is a reasonable increase in decentralisation, and in what timeframe? Additional SMART criteria (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, & Time-related), could go a long way in offering concrete ways to evaluate the project's success.",

There is also a lot of unnecessary content, like the \"Truth about Data\" section which is not required to understand the proposal. Saying that the proposal identifies real issues with IdeaScale, like the difficulty in finding information from previous funds and so it address the challenge. I'm not sure if replacing IdeaScale with a new platform is the best solution, specially when no concrete alternative is being proposed.

Secondly, whilst I agree with the most of the details presented here on how and what to look for in validating quality of projects, keeping to standards & ROI, I find it hard to accept that this is better served & performed decentrally as opposed to a more central/appointed/annointed committee or company or a group of people who can maintain the sets of standards to measure. We as Cardano would do ourselves a disservice knowing our blockchain is peer-reviewed and rigorously wrung through academics and experts to then have to rely on a decentralised approach to validate the projects that are tacked on to Cardano and funded by Catalyst, by relatively unknown parties. At least now with IOG being in charge of auditing, there is comfort knowing its being done to a certain standard and one we can trust. ",

This lack of information makes it difficult to properly assess its feasibility or future strength, although there are several ways to achieve this, some are more decentralized than others and directly impact the longevity of such a project.\n\nThere is also no mention of long term support.

At least 90% of any secured funds will go towards this portion of the project. What is not clear is has the proposer identified the exact competencies of the software developers that he needs and whether he will be able to oversee their work properly and ensure smooth delivery. \nAs the project is being proposed by a single proposer, without a developer team in place - or clearly identified (at least in terms of competencies), it remains to be seen whether the proposer can really deliver on the expected first stage results: \"a private and stable price oracle and REST-API database bridge that is suitable for traditional tax finance reporting purposes\". This is somewhat of a weakeness as the proposal would have benefited from listing the relevant skills and experience of other team members required to implement the proposal. \nAlthough the proposer gives a Q1 2022 deadline for finishing the project there is no detailed timetable for the specific stages that would allow an auditor to measure progress, which may be an important ommission. \nWhile the proposal states that at least 90% of the secured funds will go towards 2 professional freelance software developers, it is not clear how this calculation has been made and where will the remaining 10% of funds end up. \nThe three stages of the proposal ($15,000, $12,000 and $8,000) do not seem to have further cost breakdown so it is difficult to judge how well they are prepared and how realistic they are, especially as the software developers are not part of the team yet. So, are these estimates too high, are they too low, are they just right? How much coding services will be required, how many hours of work, how much will an hour of freelance coding cost? Further details may make this proposal very firm and very tight. In case it is not voted for in Fund 5, it would be good if the proposer were to resubmit it with the additional information - a clearer timetable and better identified team/tasks and costs would make it very very good. \n\n\n",

The three individual phases do not have deadlines for completion, which could mean that the proposer either forgot to include them or has not developed a clear timetable for each stage. The proposer did include metrics for measuring the end result (\"a report of the comprehensive tax picture for the user that includes the determination of income from staking ADA, any gain or loss from selling ADA, income from receiving payments in ADA for any other reason, and the potential tax liability form sales or exchanges of ADA that was received, but not purchased\"). There is a clear understandable description of the problem and a solution is offered, however the proposal could provide more information about the technical challenges. The proposer is currently acting solo - without a team/group of software developers. The experience of the software team members is key for developing a good private and stable price oracle and REST-API database bridge - but it is impossible to assess that developer experience currently in this proposal, as this will come later when the \"2 professional freelance software developers\" (no details about required skills and experience) come on board. Taking into account that is a technical, software proposal for a DApp/Integration, the  lack of verifiable experience of the to-be-identified developers is  a minus in terms of assessing its feasibility. We don't know anything about the two key people who will develop the software component of this project.

In other words, he has experience with the activity intended here, an experience that can be viewed better through the link that was attached. It is a site that speaks the newest SPO in question, has a means of contact and so on. Despite this, a more definite notion about the other team members could have been included in the proposal as well, because I believe that the SPO is not fully taught by the author, individually. It would then be interesting to know who the other people involved are, their areas of expertise and so on.\n",

I will quote here\" YaySwap is more than just a platform to swap assets; here are some fascinating features about our project:\" \n\nHowever, the features in my view are too general and lack meat on the bones. This is primarily a technical project (DApp) and it should be heavy on technical aspects if it is to compensate for the lack of the documented experience of the team. \n As it stands now, it seems like the proposers do have the vision for what could be a solution, but lack a full blown technical and operational plan. \n\nReceiving and sending crypto requires compliance with some rules and also requires support teams that are available and also could lead to legal exposure if problems are incurred. Some aspects of the proposal gloss over the risks and challenges. \n\nUnfortunately, for a project of this scope it may seem unsatisfactory that the team is anonymous and that the team apparently needs to outsource all key technical components (\"If you have experience with Plutus, developing smart contracts, react, java, c++, or a good UI/UX designer and like our project, send us your resume \").\n\nAs regards anonymity, the telegram group of the proposal states that \"Due to legal concerns, the team has chosen to be semi-anonymous at the moment. \" - which indicates a problem of legal nature - which undermines the likelihood of this proposal's successful implementation.\n\nBefore submitting a proposal for a DEX that will involve other people's assets and funds, I would expect the proposers to resolve any outstanding legal issues that require them to retain anonymity. \n\nThe risk to the proposers may be grave, serious or minor, but as the proposal stands - the risk of jeopardizing Catalyst treasury funds - is then equally serious. This unresolved legal jeopardy for the proposing team makes it unlikely the proposal will be implemented successfully, as the issues has not been resolved by the time of my assessment.\n\nFurthermore, this legal issue should have been well presented, detailed and fleshed out in the proposal itself. The fact that it is not addressed well in the proposal itself, is a problem. I had to search through the Telegram group to find these risks and threats to the project. \n\nAs it stands, the proposers are only hinting to it in general terms in the Telegram chat group (http://t.me/yayswap) - which means that I can only guess about how serious it is. This reduces the likelihood of the proposal's viability to a minimum in my eyes. \n\n\n\n",

I recommend that this is detailed and that it is informed how many people will develop this project and details of these people.\n\nThe plan describes a clear roadmap with objective goals, but several details need to be clarified:\n\nWhat is the purpose of launching a token before dapp is released?\n\nThe plan lacks some information to be viable, such as:\n\nThere is no definition of an economic model to be implemented at DEX and this is one of the main factors in any DEX.\n\nThe described wrapped assets model is extremely centralized, which creates dependency on contract administrators. Wrapped tokens are an unresolved problem, at Ethereum there are several BTC tokens, but most involve centralized solutions, where developers have access to the private key of the original BTC and could simply apply an exit scam and take all the money. The point is that wrapped assets do not yet have an ideal model and it is important to make the risks clear, mainly because we are talking about DeFi and the idea is decentralization and not pseudo decentralization.\n\nSeveral security risks were not considered, such as:\n\n-Lack of audit on smart contracts.\n-Risk of centralization of smart contracts in developers (so far they are anonymous and this is a considerable risk)\n-There is no definition of an economic model to be implemented at DEX and this is one of the main factors in any DEX.\n\nConsidering the fact that the purpose is to be a fully decentralized DEX, there is no mention of creating a governance model. A dapp controlled by the developers is not DeFi, it is true that a project needs centralization in the beginning to be developed, but the absence of a governance distribution plan is a problem that needs to be addressed.\n\nAn important point to note is that the YAYSWAP team conducted an IDO on the Exmarkets lauchpad (https://exmarkets.com/launchpad/yay-btc) that week and raised $ 600,000 USD. According to the link, 2,040,000 YAY tokens were sold, with a soft cap of $ 60,000 and traded at a price of $ 0.25USD, for a total of 240,000 YAY tokens sold in thatsoft cap amount. The rest of the tokens (1,800,000) were sold for $ 0.30USD. This can be verified in the link above.\n\nI am not taking into account the fact that the team raised money in an IDO, this aspect does not influence my score. The reason I am including this information in the assessment is for transparency to voters, as the team raised a considerable amount of funds outside of Catalyst and this is not described in the proposal, although the team has published it on Twitter.",

So the official reddit sub of YaySwap is full with new accounts with almost no karma that write really short comments. I know nobody is able to fully control a subreddit but there is no official information or anything on this sub. \n\nThen I came here and in the comments it is exactly the same. There are a 100 comments but all of them are really short and don't really provide any content. There are just a few that are asking critical questions but nobody answered them. \n\nIt would really benefit your proposal if you would expain who these 4 MCGill Alumni are or even better just introduce the whole team. Maybe provide a link to your Linkedin page. It always helps to built trust in a project If you know the people that are behind it. I visited your website to look for further information but I couldn't find anything there regarding your team/company.\n\nThere is a comment stating: There is no technique documents, there is no any person to develope. But request too much money (1 mill at first time, then 250k, 100k, now 65k). It just focus to attract people to its channels and collects data. - Why did you reduce your budget again and again but after you got feedback from the community there is still no budget in the proposal. It is important for the funder to see where the funds are going and how they are allocated. \n\nThen a DEX needs a lot of coding. I was looking for your github link in the proposal but I did not find one. A proposal should not only mention on what is going to be done but also on how it is going to be done. If you explain some technical aspects this is going to help to build trust a lot.\n\n",

However, to be fair, they're already a bit interested \u2013 and of course if they find a platform supplying with good information and intuitive navigation it'll help to aggregate them in the Project. But maybe if this platform includes more general information and educational (in a easy way) contents (starting from the beginning \u2013 decentralization, crypto potential, crypto intention, difference between the ecosystems, etc) and then present the Cardano and the Catalyst Project, I think it would have a greater strength to aggregate not only the people who are already looking and already know about it, but it could get newcomers into this world. \n",

It is known that the crypto world is not intuitive nor easy to understand to the public. It mixes several themes that are not often well grounded to the people such as concepts of economy and computational technology.\nThe idea to create a not long series of easy-to-understand videos that creates a solid ground to the people at least start to walk by their selves is great.\n\nTherefore, I think it would be more productive if we could add some base knowledge into the first video. Assuming that the people that are seeking this kind of content do not know this world, as stated, then we want them to first understand what being into this world mean. Thus, we must introduce the concept of decentralization and why it's a good way to embrace it in the world as it is today and as it'll be tomorrow, introduce the concept of DeFi (because money is a great incentive), the concept of validation and the difference between PoW and PoS associating them with the environmental problem (always bringing the content to the real world).\nAfter these little introductions and explanations, and just then, enter with the second theme video (What is Cardano and Project Catalyst). At this point, you've introduced the major and simpler concepts that makes the eyes bright when we think about the future of technology, world and practicality.\n\nThe reason why I think this may be a good approach is because the best way to attract someone without knowledge of the subject is to create an idea of profitability, not only due to money, but also due to practicality, sustainability, trustless actions, etc.\n\nI really enjoy the adding of surveys as an attempt to try to measure the conversion of viewers to new participants to the Catalyst Project, and the understanding of the need to hire a professional to make these calculations and compose the data needed to know if the series is really giving result. \n\nSince it will use YT platform to promote the series, depending on how the proposer use the platform, it's very scalable to the general public, and if the series is well constructed, it will reach a vast public.\n",

This would make implementation easier as all they'll have to do is little education about Cardano for these individuals.\nTo asses their plans, it is good that within the first 3 months of receiving funding, the project can be built, implemented and running already. That shows how serious this team is and foremost view of how committed they're gonna remain as long as the project operates.\nAlso, creation of treasury out of returns and rewards is a good idea.

Work on the project has already begun and the project is in the initial stages. The proposed budget seems very reasonable and the proposal as a whole a very good allocation of treasury funds. The only thing I would have liked to see in addition to what's currently in the proposal is a more detailed planned structure for the future guides and how they intend to present the learning material.",
