I tried to open every attachment and read through all segments - but just couldn't locate it. Only based on this alone - I would be very cautious about proceeding with funding. Second - I am unable to establish validity of claims/experience. I am not entirely convinced for a need to attach sample email communication with IOHK nor referencing so heavily their name in the process. It seems more of a marketing move than one with substance. That's really strange form to me. It also says in experience that author has asked Ben G. from Singularity - but again - what does it have to do with proposal. It is nice sideshow - but we need to focus on content of this proposal. It reads very poorly. It reads like a concept more than executable proposal.

Also - having ability to improve membership would be fantastic on Catalyst platform. Any thoughts how that could be measured effectively, too?

Maybe it is good if in the meantime the application would be applied at lower level elections e.g. local elections, and then the success of the idea and its implementation could serve as an example for raising the popularity and raising the ladder of political life throughout the country.",

Has a study/survey been done how existing customers are looking at this prospect? Is the reliability of growth tied to the existing platform? If so - what growth patterns has been seen to date?

The sales pitch is: more of your funds go directly to the research instead of being siphoned off wending their way through the university's bureaucratic structure.

No doubt there are a lot of great ideas conjured by people who have no experience whatsoever with the subject matter. This is not the case here. This proposal effectively addresses the challenge because it provides a roadmap how Mr. Ghareeb and his team will create a quality dapp that will be implemented successfully in the real world. Research funding for scientists could be substantially shifted from the university mechanism to Cardano, involving thousands or millions of dollars. There is a clear path to success and even potential expansion, increasing the utility of the dapp, which to me means collectively that this dapp will be a winner.  It would be helpful to describe generally how the scientists seeking funding and the funders would interact with the dapp. For example, would scientists be required to clearly state the product of the research? Would funders be permitted to dole out funds based upon milestones? Would scientists be asked to describe the intended research in layman's terms? Would funders be permitted to request a certain type of research for a certain amount of money? This may be going into too much detail but something generally about user experience and the operation of the contractual mechanism would be helpful. A more detailed roadmap and milestones would be helpful. Also, citation of risks and challenges would demonstrate the proposer's understanding of the problem. For example, will funders be able to wade through research proposals? Will scientists not have access to university resources and/or faculty that they would normally have? The definition of success generally seems clear, but providing more specific metrics would be helpful (e.g. number of scientists funded by a certain amount within a certain amount of time).",

At the moment I think this is not possible to store an entire book (the up limit for metadata in transactions is 16KB) and it is not advisable in order to prevent the blockchain to grow too much. Therefore it will be necessary to use an external (perhaps decentralized) mechanism: it would be great to add this information to the proposal.\nAnother aspect that it is not really clear to me concerns the \"reading access\". In the proposal is described that \"readers\" that hold BOOK tokens have access to the Library, but if the books are stored in a blockchain aren't they already visible to everyone?\nApart from these specificities it would be useful to have a detailed development plan, including a description of the technologies / languages (in particular for smart contracts) that will be used, a development roadmap and costs breakdown.\n",

The artist could choose how many tokens to mint and how many they are willing to part with. Goldstone Eterprises could choose to purchase them if they like. The tokens should be freely traded after minting. The value of the token would be determined by the success of the project.\n\nGodstone Enterpirses could hold 25% of the of the GSN coin automatically, without any cause for concern.

The referenced files in the proposal are not open - and I was unable to access them directly. \n\nThe proposer does mention \"Competition analysis is also done - basically all competitors run on the Ethereum blockchain (with enormous gas fees) and a lot of them are already inactive, giving us a very good advantage to build a product and make it more affordable and easier to use.\", however this is not the same as saying that the proposer is committed to Cardano for transactions and smart contracts. It may be a given, but unless it is directly stated (no references to using Plutus, Cardano Dapps, etc) - I have to keep my mind open to whether the proposer may switch platforms during the project, if not explicitly committed. \n\nOne commenter asked \"which language platform will be used (Plutus, Marlowe, etc)? \", but the information has not been reported back as far as I could see.

The team has also considered its progress and deployment against the current global pandemic and presented potential solutions to ensure health and safety for participants. The potential involvement of Uber and Lyft, if successful, can lead to immediate adoption by la arge number of ride-sharing users who by most surveys share a concern for the environment with desires to minimise carbon footprints.

I found only terms and conditions page - no about us or people behind as such. Adding some sort of links that would enable us to verify/establish validity of professional claims be very desirable. Maybe a linked in profiles, or some previous project references. However, I appreciate the effort typing out background in the proposal itself. That's a plus - just missing that 'verified' momentum to it a bit. A quick comment about budget - it breaks down somewhat into greater detail - but we don't really know how many developers are going to be paid for? Budget only states this amount is for developers. Experience section states 3 fullstack developers and team section discusses 2 of them. Would be great to clear up team dynamics next time to help clear any additional doubts. ",

The historical track record points to this potential. Despite the challenges associated with liquidity, African stock markets have performed remarkably well, both in terms of absolute returns and on a risk-adjusted basis. The risk adjustment is done using the standard Sharpe ratio that scale average return by volatility. As shown in Table 5, the average annual return for these markets over the past 10 years was 25%. With the exceptionA particularly important outgrowth of the extensive financial sector reforms in Africa, including policy measures for the development of capital markets, has been a surge of interest in the establishment of stock exchanges, particularly in Sub-Sahara Africa. Stock exchanges have proliferated over the last two decades. There were only 5 stock exchanges in SSA 20 years ago and 3 in North Africa, but now there are about 20 in operation. There has also been a market capitalization boom in Africa, with the exception of the two oldest markets in South Africa and Egypt which came into existence in 1880s. What is also interesting is that SSA witnessed an establishment of a regional stock exchange domiciled in Abidjan, which currently serves the Francophone countries of West Africa. There are, in fact, similar initiatives underway in Southern and Eastern Africa to consolidate the thinly capitalized markets into regional markets.",

Now this kind of service allows one to quickly start a project and add decentralization later (at a cost) so this lowers the barrier of entry for new developers to do stuff right away.\nThis concern is not addressed in the project, probably because there is a conflict of interest on their part (making their customer dependent on their service is more sustainable long term) their services are currently free for the first 100,000 requests.

In each proposal the requested amount varies depending on the language.\nMy only concern about this kind of service is that it makes an application dependent on the API provider, which goes against decentralization. Now this kind of service allows one to quickly start a project and add decentralization later (at a cost) so this lowers the barrier of entry for new developers to do stuff right away.\nThis concern is not addressed in the project, probably because there is a conflict of interest on their part (making their customer dependent on their service is more sustainable long term) their services are currently free for the first 100,000 requests. A list of their APIs can be found at docs.blockfrost.io (link not provided in the description).\nWe would have also liked to have more detail on the kind of service they already provide and their future plans...",

While there is pretty good identification of problem and proposed solution - I would have loved to learn more about challenges/risks that authors are thinking about implementation of the proposed solution.

What information do we have to confirm that the ban was caused by this reason? We know that the cryptocurrency-related \"bans\" that took place in Nigeria were influenced by the government's monetary policy, as this was made public weeks ago. If a government's interest is to ban cryptocurrencies to preserve the country's financial system and prevent capital flight, the approach to reversing the ban is not as simple as demystifying scratches in the image of cryptos due to scams, the challenge would be much greater and would involve political interests.\n\nI am raising this topic because the proposal's problem statement is subjective and doesn't make it clear what the scenario is in Congo, regardless of the reasons that are causing this crackdown, I think it is important that the idea be taken forward, because the proposal to educate people is the focus.",

They have a good webpage. They promise a lot of things like yield farming pools hedge fund crypto hedge fund fiat offshore bank e.t.c. nft marketplace micro casino. They also have a road map,they have a team.They will have a dapp for phone. But the real prob is that all of these things rocks. Smells bad and the reasons i said that is that the address of the office they have is in rent. In the video they have about 45 min they show no face and they all the time said things like \"This shit is legit how they make 4000$ in 4 days. \"How much money they make\" etc . The people they seems to have in the team some off them are already ceo in other companies and they don't live in Australia.And for end they have an open ico.That some one can go and buy their token before it is out in the markets. I dont know really all seems too good too promising. Hope and greed in one place. Maybe i am totally wrong. I wait for the admins answer to change my rating.",

The brief mentions questions such as - did we manage to attract users to the platform? Did our efforts result in new, viable applications built on top of Cardano? The focus of the proposal - tokenize agricultural products of Colombian farmers - is too general to take into account the specific nature of agri-food products (phytosanitary certificates, quality issues, storage, rotting, short shelf life, transport, delivery terms, crop insurance, you name it...)",

The budget is fuzzy but this you state clearly. Maybe also try to work out a budget based on some realities. From what i've gathered i think you have in mind \"modest\" universities and the rental system would be not so expensive, however if you aim to rent a room for a whole semester at Harvard or one of the most expensive, maybe your budget is low. All in all we need at least one comparaison point grounded in reality. What i mean is \"for this university which i contacted, they would agree to rent us a room for X\".

I believe that it would be more reasonable to divide the proposal into two parts, First the elaboration of a proof of concept, so that in a second stage of fundind we can have something more tangible to evaluate.\n\nThe experiences described in the proposal are relevant the proposal described, but it is important that more details are presented, how many people will participate in the project, their professional experiences and qualifications, also recommend the inclusion of link to Github and LinkedIn (if possible).",

The \"relevant experience\" section mentions a team but actual links to those people public profile or atleast the main person (e.g. linkedin profile) is not to be seen. \n2. Phase 1: Point 1. This phase explanation is not supported by any prior projects done by the proposer or his/her team e.g. has the team taken any similar endeavor in past that Cardano community can look at and be confident that team indeed has this experience? Point 2. This point depends on the premise of the problem statement that Farmers will suffer from the privatization and middleman profits. IMHO Indian government has a sour relationship with NGOs in recent years and this statement seems to be more inline with going against the government rather than actually addressing the concerns of farmers.\nPhase 2 and Phase 3 makes sense only when Phase 1 is clear to the voting community. Overall, the statement and phases should be supported subjectively.\n\n",

As they feel more confident about the ecosystem, they can certainly go deeper via other sources, such as gimbalabs, official docs, white papers etc.\n3.

Where does the proposer get the big fashion brand? There is no evidence of a real connection between proposer and a university (maybe there really is, but it is not documented). Lobbying in EU for digital Euro? The ECB is already official working on this (https://www.ecb.europa.eu/euro/digital_euro/html/index.en.html). The proposer stated \"concrete steps (\u2026) for introduction to regulators\" but missed to say what the concrete steps may are.

However, there are some problems that I see in the proposal itself, as the proposal does address the challenge - but in my view it doesn't do it effectively enough. Effectively is a key word. What do I mean? I think that the proposal is not focused enough on encouraging entrepreneurs, which is the focus group. The proposer suggests: \"Post this Challenge on LinkedIN/Social Media and ask for comments, invite people to ideascale to create profiles and review proposals.\" Creating profiles and reviewing proposals - is not the immediate goal. Reaching people over social media does not automatically translate into encouraging entrepreneurs, and I see this as a weakness of this specific proposal. It could benefit from much more added detail and a very specific gameplan on how to leverage the advantages of the LinkedIn and other social media platforms to attract companies and entrepreneurs. The proposal is too generic in my view, without a well-thought out plan. ",

To reach a large target group organically on LinkedIn, you need a large network, which the team may have (500+ on LinkedIn). On the other hand, paid ads on LinkedIn are very expensive (approx. 10$ per click!). I am missing a detailed plan on how the budget is going to spend. So, I can't judge if it is reasonable. For only organic traffic (incl. content creation) it seems to be too high (as I work in this industry). For a paid campaign there is no specific plan (including KPIs).

The requested funds are USD 25000, however the proposer also specifies in the proposal and the comments that he will \"be working with two other proposals to create some branding and marketing collateral, so $1000 to infographics,\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Infographics-Series-1/340837-48088\nand $1000 to swarm sessions\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Voltaire-Assistant-Swarm-Sessions/340811-48088\"\nThis raises more questions - what happens if these two other proposals also receive funding and why would this proposal be allocating additional funding to two other proposals that are already applying for funding in a separate effort. What if all three proposals are selected by the community for funding, do we have an overfunding situation. These are important issues that involve community funds and need to be thought out well and addressed by the proposer. \nI would have liked to see more information about the proposers experience with Linkedin promotional campaigns, metrics, other proof of the proposers suitability to implement this project.

A brief description of each stage is necessary to have clarity in terms of deliverables which is missing. Also, there is a missing stage for testing. It would great to have testing with the community possibly with the test tokens before going live. This test phase would help the product to be more robust and well-prepared for Go Live.\n\nDEX isn't a novel idea thus there is reference available in the current crypto environments so it is important to have clear information on the steps involved. Thus more research and information needs to be furnished.\n\nTeam capabilities seem to be up to the mark considering experience in relevant products and native tools on Cardano though reference to completed projects and more clarity in terms skill would have had better impact. Considering the team lead is involved in multiple projects he might spread thin thus making him less efficient.\n\nIt is good to see there is research done to bring out the disadvantages of DEXs in other systems.

It might be a noble idea if realized, but I am not clear on how can voters participating in Project Catalyst vote on funding allocations that are exclusively in the competence of a separate legal entity such as the CF. \n",

It does certainly help to implement the transactions as long as there is funding for the donations, but does it really further adoption after the initial donation is spent?

The project specifies that for each content (Infoblock), the team will create an infographic distributed as a static image, a base text detailing the content in more depth, a video with simple graphic animations and narration based on the text. But the proposal does not address how many infoblocks will be produced, how many contributors will be onboarded and other metrics - which makes it difficult to assess feasibility of outcome. ",

However, many arguments are laid out that seem to be partly wishful thinking:\n\n-  The market will have confidence that standardized prices for BHN commodities are accurately established. \n- Producers can use the Item Banc Engine's data to determine where the most profitable markets are to export their products, to properly hedge their production and inventories. - - The financial markets will have a better way to value currencies. \n\nThese are claims with far-reaching consequences for this project, but are based on suppositions and as such I am not sure about the \"Quality integration\" part of the proposal.

There are almost certainly many, many more ways that we the Cardano ecosystem could benefit from additional bridges and interoperability with Ethereum. A huge amount of the expertise in Blockchain is working in the Ethereum ecosystem. So bridges and collaborations between chains would be beneficial to both. \n2) Is this addressing a \"green pasture\" opportunity that could improve the well-being across a major region or globally? \n\nAt this point in time I would also say that there are only a few truly compelling use cases in the Ethereum ecosystem. It is true that it is a new financial system, but to date it is mainly a speculative one for trading money and focusing on short term gains. The real value is in delivering high fidelity systems that translate well across the world and bring in people and resources that are currently ignored, devalued or inaccessible to the current financial system. Right now Ethereum is mainly useful as a new form of trading for fintech bros, macro wonks and gold bugs. So the main benefit would be by attracting developers. Useful, but as in the island, pond and ocean analogy there probably is actually a lot more talent and expertise elsewhere. \n\n3) How much will the requested funds catalyze this effort and produce a meaningful result over the next few years? \n\nThe amount of funds requested are the entire community challenge amount. This should be significant enough to really foster interest, buzz and community support around the effort. I personally don't like that the whole fund is being requested, but to stay faithful to my assessment it actually would be a huge statement about how serious Cardano is to bridging to Ethereum. ",

Very similar to porting IOS games over to Android. With the tools that IOG is providing to help bridge the gap, there is already a foundation to build on and probably a lot of benefit to providing people an easy way to try out the Cardano blockchain for work they have already done in Ethereum. \n\n2) Circle of competence: is there enough competence and passion in the ecosystem so proposals will have great leadership and synergy between team, partners and/or community?\n\nThis one is hard to assess. Right now, the blockchain community is very tribal and dominated by maximalism. I think this is changing, but it is very possible that the Ethereum community has a lot of entrenched loyalists so could be hard to establish bridges. That said, there is also a tremendous amount of entrepreneurial energy in blockchain which means people will want to roll with the latest and greatest tech (which Cardano is, right!?). So creating support and focus on inviting those entrepeneurs to bridge to Cardano could have a very large upside.  \n\n3) Accelerators: Are there clear network effects or other advantages that will drive success?\n\nYes. Ethereum is the largest blockchain, smart contract development ecosystem right now. Success in creating ethereum bridges and collabs would probably have a large positive ripple effect",

Liqwid itself is a possible solution to this problem, but it is still in development and it should still take a few months for its first version to be ready. So, for this challenge to be feasible, we need Goguen's delivery, money market dapps operating (Liqwid for example), functional oracles and credit score projects.

It seems like pretty specialized work though, so I'm not sure. \n\n3) Accelerators: Are there clear network effects or other advantages that will drive success?\n\nBy the time Fund6 arrives, smart contracts will barely be released (or maybe not even released yet). This challenge is important, but seems a little premature at this time. ",
