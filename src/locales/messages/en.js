    EXPLANATION: " The <b>PA ID Finder tool</b> is designed to help you finding out what is your Proposal Assessor (PA) ID in previous funds.\
                  <br>Knowing your PA-ID is the first step to check your performance in a fund, your assessments that were filtered out, the feedback received from Veteran Proposal Assessors (vPAs) and more.\
                  <br>It is easier to find your ID if you have saved an assessment that you have submitted in IdeaScale.\
                  If you have not done so, it might still be possible to find your ID.",
