    EXPLANATION: " The <b>PA ID Finder tool</b> is designed to help you finding out what is your Proposal Assessor (PA) ID in previous funds.\
                  <br>Knowing your PA-ID is the first step to check your performance in a fund, your assessments that were filtered out, the feedback received from Veteran Proposal Assessors (vPAs) and more.\
                  <br>It is easier to find your ID if you have saved an assessment that you have submitted in IdeaScale.\
                  If you have not done so, it might still be possible to find your ID.",

    EXPLANATION: "<em>The <b>Proposal Assessor ID</b> is anonymous and may or may not represent the same person in two different Funds.</em> \
                  <br>With this PA-ID Finder, you can now use the texts from assessments you've done and other advanced filtering to find out your PA-ID on specific Funds you have assessed.\
                  <br><br><b>How the search works:</b><ul>\
                  <li>If a slice of an assessment text is provided, this tool will find the IDs that have submitted assessments containing the <b>exact</b> query text provided for the search.\
                  <br><b>Be careful! Any mismatching spelling between the assessment and the query text will return no results.</b> \
                  <li>If the advanced filtering is used, we'll provide the IDs that have submitted assessments to at least all conditions selected for the search. \
                  </ul> \
                  In the results, the tool provides the PA-IDs found for the search, and the assessments matching the search criteria.\
                  <br>For each PA-ID provided, one can have access to the assessments themselves, as well as to the Proposal's URL and Assessor's information page.",
