    EXPLANATION: " The <b>PA ID Finder tool</b> is designed to help you finding out what is your Proposal Assessor (PA) ID in previous funds.\
                  <br>Knowing your PA-ID is the first step to check your performance in a fund, your assessments that were filtered out, the feedback received from Veteran Proposal Assessors (vPAs) and more.\
                  <br>It is easier to find your ID if you have saved an assessment that you have submitted in IdeaScale.\
                  If you have not done so, it might still be possible to find your ID.",

    EXPLANATION: "<em>The <b>Proposal Assessor ID</b> is independent for each Fund.</em> \
                  In other words, a specific ID may or may not represent the same person in two different Funds. \
                  <br>With this PA-ID Finder, you can search for ID's considering a given Fund: \
                  <br>- If a slice of an assessment text is provided, we'll provide the PA-IDs that have submitted assessments containing the exact text of the search; \
                  <br>- If the advanced search is used, we'll provide the PA-IDs that have submitted assessments to at least all conditions selected for the search. \
                  <br>At the search results, one can have access to the assessments themselves, as well as to the Proposal's url and Assessor's information",
